React + Jest + Enzyme
=====================

One evening Jenn decided to try converting [~starter-react-router](https://starter-react-router.glitch.me) to use es6 and then add tests to it. This is that project.

Click `Show` in the header to see your app live. Updates to your code will instantly deploy and update live.

Your Project
------------

On the front-end,
- edit files in `app` folder, it contains all the React stuff
- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project

On the back-end,
- your app starts at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)
